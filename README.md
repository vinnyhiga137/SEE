## An Open-Source Game Engine made with C++

This game engine was made for supporting simple 2D and 3D rendering with input polling, basic physics, basic A.I. pathfinding, basic sound engine and networking system for Windows and Mac OS systems.

## Why create "another" game engine?

The main ideia (for now) is to set this project as self-learning project for everyone who wants to study game engines architectures and how they work on each subsystem / layer (e.g. Gameplay Subsystems, Rendering Subsystem, Audio Subsystem, Physics Subsystem, A.I. Subsystem).

## METAS

* Initally must support Windows 10 (64 bits) and Mac OS Catalina (even if OpenGL was deprecated, but in the future this engine will be using Metal).
* 2D Rendering with Sprite Batching.
* 3D Rendering with simple material system (Don't expect PBR for now).
* Basic Keyboard + Mouse input and Joypad input.
* Basic 2D physics and 3D physics.
* Basic pathfinding (A* with something else).
* Tilemap support.
* 2D/3D audio.
* Simple network system.

## Can I expect something more?

* In the future this engine must run in iOS / iPadOS devices by communicating with Swift / Objective-C.
* Would be cool to try run this engine on some gaming console (It'll be cool challenge for running on different CPU's architectures).
